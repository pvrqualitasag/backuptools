# Preparing Jobs
All directories that must be backedup in a given job are written to a file. The file has to have extension `.bjob` to be considered as input for the backup script.


# Running the Commands
Because of file permission issues, the backup job itself must be run as root. 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sudo su - -c "/home/quagadmin/backup/bash/run_backup_jobs.sh -d &> /home/quagadmin/backup/log/`date +'%Y%m%d%H%M%S'`_run_backup_jobs.log"
```

The first part with `sudo su - -c` was taken from https://deanattali.com/2015/05/09/setup-rstudio-shiny-server-digital-ocean/.
