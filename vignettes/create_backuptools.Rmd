## Disclaimer
This document describes the creation process of a set of bash scripts all used for doing different sorts of backups.  


## Dependencies and Requirements
Commonly used bash utility functions are kept in a project/package (still to be created) which should be available for the scripts in this package. 


## Package Architecture
This package uses a central script called `backup_data.sh` for simple backing up of data stored under a common directory somewhere in the directory tree. The content of this directory is compressed into a gzipped-tar-achrive and moved to a specified target directory.


## Specialiced Functionality
More specialised features such as running backups for the gogs-repository or the transfer of backup files to remote backup locations is implemented in their own specific scripts.
